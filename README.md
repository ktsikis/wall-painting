# wall-painting
this repository is my thesis for my diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering in Democritus University of Thrace
we create an application that we manually select a piece of a wall to be paint 
selection methods are: 
polygon ( drawing lines to create the perimeter of the wall) and 
magic hand ( select the wall with a special tool like the magic wand)

after we use a plenty of methods to paint the selected wall keeping the original texture

the main scrypt(WindowMode.py) contains the application and the wall_paint.py contains all the fuction to support algorithmic the application.
